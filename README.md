# Custom Snippet Samples

This repository contains examples of the [Custom Snippets](TODO: link to Custom
Snippets doc here) feature of [Styra DAS](https://www.styra.com/styra-das/).

The sample custom snippets can be found in the file
[`./samples/custom_snippet_samples.rego`](./samples/custom_snippet_samples.rego).

This repository also includes a validation script to help you detect problems
in your custom snippet metadata, which is located in the
[validator](./validator) folder.
